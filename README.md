TaletXchange is a platform where one user offers his skills to teach another user, while getting the other user to coach him a skill as well. In Singapore, people have a low frequency of interactions within a community due to hectic lifestyle. Our application is a one-stop online hub for skill exchange based in the community. Through this application, a user is able to teach another user a skill or hobby while also being taught a skill or hobby by them. In our opinion, this application would suit individuals who are in their 40s-50s as they have more spending power and free time, thus would be more willing to engage in skills exchange.
